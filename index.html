            <p>I am a very creative person and would love to be able to learn more about the programmes used to put my ideas into theory and work my way to completing the course and working my way through university to become a professional web designer, as I feel this is the perfect career for me.</p>

            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>I’m a designer who codes. I'm also the author of Master (a book about design systems, web design, and product design). I’ve worked internationally, in-house, and remotely on projects for leading brands, agencies, startups, and charities. I care deeply about creating world-class, useful, and beautiful products that help people and make a difference. I can be as involved in your project as you need me to be; from the seed of the idea, to sketches, creative direction, design, copywriting, system design, and even the front-end and WordPress build.</p>
